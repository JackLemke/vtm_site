## General Information


For this project, we were to create and design a portfolio flask website. I used html and python languages to build and code the website. We used calculations and I designed using a CSS stylesheet and included images of the maintenance. The site includes a home or index page, an about page, and an interactive estimator page that can be used to estimate the cost of tank maintenance by inputting a radius and height of a tank.
